1st - I received a call from TCS that they found my profile and shared some info about the role and asked me send RTR confirmation (With salary expectations). 2nd (Same day) - I got a call from a Business relationship manager that there is an urgent opening and asked if I can interview rightaway. I said its already 5 so how about tomorrow? Then he replied that its urgent opening so if you can find sometime now! I said ok let's go for it. But after 30mins (around 6PM) I got a call that interviewer is not available so let's schedule tomorrow. 3rd (Next day) - I had an interview for half an hour, few basic java and springboot related questions and then I got schduled for client interview on the next day 4th - I had an interview with client, same questions being asked. 5th - I got some good news that I have been selected and received an email with saying congratulations and some info like HR will contact me in next 3 working days 6th - (I kept waiting...... ) and now from this point I started noticing level of unprofessionalism, after waiting for 5 days finally I got a random call from HR (no schedule/ no email - just direct call). She started with compensation which was 5k less than what I asked for in the RTR confirmation. I denied to go below my range so she said OK I will try and get back to you tomorrow. 7th - (poor me kept waiting for another 2 days.. no response) kept checking email for 2 days then decided to call her and ask. And she said oh yes yes.. It's all good, don't worry. you might receive an offer today/tomorrow. 8th - I waited whole day ðŸ˜© and then the next day and next day... nothing came.. so I sent followup email and no response.. Finally HR got some time after 3 days and replied that the offer is getting ready but by that time I got great offer from other company and I denied. Be aware and stay away rather than putting yourself in a hopeless position. The way they deal with people is so not right and very unprofessional.
